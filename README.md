## Summary
Redirect to and from youtube.com, invidio.us, or hooktube.com based on your
setting.

I also added code for hovering over any link and if you hit "c" it copies the
url of the link you are hovering over to the selection buffer. For me, on linux,
that copies.

Lots of extra code. I don't write many extensions.
